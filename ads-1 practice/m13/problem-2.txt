Q) Is an array that is sorted in Ascending order a min-oriented heap? Why?
Ans: Yes the array which is sorted in Ascending order is a min-oriented heap
because there will be no swapping of the elements between the parent and child in the binary heap tree.
Example:
array = [1,2,3,4,5]
          1
        2   3
      4   5
